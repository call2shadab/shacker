        <p><b>For company registrationwala.com: </b>I had worked for registrationwala.com as a freelancer. I made a crawler for them that also recognizes numeric captcha. For captcha recognition I made a CNN.</p>
        <p><b>In Smart India Hackathon 2018: </b>Together with the team of 6 members I participated in Smart India Hackathon 2018 and made it to Grand Finale. We made a webside that shows all state and central government schemes on a integrated single website. I made a crawler using Python that crawls all the schemes.</p>

                Jan 2019 - Feb 2019
                <br>
                In this project I made a numeric captcha recognizer using OpenCV and
TensorFlow in Python. I made a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The
numeric captcha recognizing accuracy was around 98%. I had done this
project individually.

                This research paper is authored by me under the guidance of teacher Mr. Rizwan Khan. In this paper we tried to make mobile payment apps more secure by using visual cryptographic techniques along with assymetric encryption and decryption the details contained in QR code of payment apps.
